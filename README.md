## IV. Insights

- Overall, we see that the number of customers leaving is quite large, accounting for 1,796 people out of a total of 6,687 analyzed customers.
- In terms of demographics, the total number of customers as well as the number of churns come from both genders at approximately the same rate, in which the number of older customers (over 30) accounts for the majority (81%). ) as well as accounting for 84% of customer churn.
- Regarding products and services, the unlimited data plan (UDP) package is commonly used by customers by 67.21%, however churned customers also use it by 80.35%, so it is necessary to find out if they quit using the service because of the package. this or not.
- Regarding the type of registration contract, customers are mainly using short-term monthly contracts (accounting for 51.01%), long-term contracts from 1-2 years account for more than 20% of each type.
- On the other hand, churned customers are mainly customers who sign up for short-term contracts, because they have low commitment ability and do not use it long enough to form a habit or have a desire to continue using it. Therefore, we can focus on improving the group of churn customers with long-term contracts (both large in number and high in commitment).
- Regarding payment method, the main used method is direct debit.
- Regarding costs, it is found that churned customers have a quite high average monthly charge, higher than the general average, however the average total charges are quite low, so churned customers belong to the group of only short-term users and do not spend too much money to Use the company's services.

## V. Recommendations

Through analyzing the characteristics of churn customer groups, there are some suggestions for businesses as follows:

Regarding products and services, we can focus on understanding why customers using UDP packages abandon the most, thereby improving churn rate.

- From the tenure bins chart, we see that the churn rate is inversely proportional to the customer's usage time, so we should focus on taking care of long-term and loyal customers to continue to retain them, and find out if why are short-term customers more likely to leave.
- From the churn reason sheet, we see that the reason is that competitors often have more attractive policies, so telecom company need to offer more attractive incentive policies to compete with the market.

Some improvement policies we suggest to focus on customer service and incentive packages are as follows:

- **Improve Customer Service:**

  - Provide excellent customer service through multiple channels, including phone, email, and online chat.
